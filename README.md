# Project Proposal

### Project title

Socialize

### What and why?

Social media managers, creators, businesses or just people in general juggle multiple platforms (e.g., Instagram, X/Twitter) but lack a unified tool to track cross-platform performance. Manually checking each platform for follower counts, engagement, and trends is time-consuming and inefficient.

**Socialize** is a centralized dashboard that aggregates analytics from multiple social media accounts into a single interface. Users can monitor follower growth and engagement rates across platforms in real time, enabling data-driven decisions without switching between apps.

### For whom?

Content creators, small business owners like startups or local shops, social media managers like influencers or marketing agencies who want a way to grow audiences and their online presence more effectively with our consolidated analytics tool.  

### How?

The system will connect accounts via OAuth middleware where users can securely link Instagram, X, and other social profiles. We will provide real-time metrics in one place that will display follower trends with Chart.js, engagement heatmaps, custom reports, alerts, etc. 

### Scope

A group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester is feasible and we can minimize third-party API complexity by limiting the social media platforms we want to use.
